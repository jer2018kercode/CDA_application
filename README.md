# CDA Test

## Project explanation
* Develop a program that will display a verse of your client's favorite song "99 non-alcoholic shots". The number of shots shown on screen will depend on the value written by the user. This number must be between 0 and 99.

## How does it work?

**Access**
- Start an IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code) and open the "CDA_Vasseur" folder. 
- Launch the "shots.php" file with PHP on your web browser.

At this point, you will have a visual of the program.

**Handling**
- Write down a number between 0 and 99 and click on "Afficher le couplet !" to make the program work.
- It is compulsory to write a number between 0 and 99. This number cannot be higher or lower than that and it has to be a number. If you do not take this into consideration while using the program, a recall message will appear on your screen.

Now it is your turn to test the program!
